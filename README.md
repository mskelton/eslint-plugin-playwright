## Installation

Yarn

  "extends": ["plugin:jest-playwright/recommended"]
}
```

## Rules

### `missing-playwright-await` ðŸ”§

Enforce Jest Playwright expect statements to be awaited.

#### Example

Example of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
expect(page).toMatchText("text");
```

Example of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
await expect(page).toMatchText("text");
```

#### Options

The rule accepts a non-required option which can be used to specify custom matchers which this rule should also warn about. This is useful when creating your own async matchers.

```json
{
  "jest-playwright/missing-playwright-await": [
    "error",
    { "customMatchers": ["toBeCustomThing"] }
  ]
}
```
