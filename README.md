ESLint plugin for [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).

## Installation

npm

```bash
npm install -D eslint-plugin-playwright
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-playwright
```

pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-playwright
```

## Usage

This plugin bundles two configurations to work with both `@playwright/test` or
`jest-playwright`. The recommended setup is to use the `files` field to target
only Playwright test files. In the examples below, this is done by targeting
files in the `tests` directory and only applying the Playwright rules to those
files. In your project, you may need to change the `files` field to match your
Playwright test file patterns.

### With [Playwright test runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests)

[Flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new)
(**eslint.config.js**)

```javascript
import playwright from 'eslint-plugin-playwright'

export default [
  {
    ...playwright.configs['flat/playwright'],
    files: ['tests/**'],
  },
  {
    files: ['tests/**'],
    rules: {
      // Customize Playwright rules
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```

[Legacy config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)
(**.eslintrc**)

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "tests/**",
      "extends": "plugin:playwright/recommended"
    }
  ]
}
```

### With [Jest Playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright)

[Flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new)
(**eslint.config.js**)

```javascript
import playwright from 'eslint-plugin-playwright'
import jest from 'eslint-plugin-jest'

export default [
  {
    ...playwright.configs['flat/jest-playwright'],
    files: ['tests/**'],
  },
  {
    files: ['tests/**'],
    plugins: { jest },
    rules: {
      // Customize Playwright rules
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```

[Legacy config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)
(**.eslintrc**)

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "tests/**",
      "extends": "plugin:playwright/jest-playwright"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Aliased Playwright Globals

If you import Playwright globals (e.g. `test`, `expect`) with a custom name, you
can configure this plugin to be aware of these additional names.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "playwright": {
      "globalAliases": {
        "test": ["myTest"],
        "expect": ["myExpect"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
